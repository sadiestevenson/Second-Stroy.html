Hello Seattle, why are you always raining?
When I rain I can release my emotions. It doesn't need to happy or sad, but today I am sad.
Today the sky has changed color, and the ocean has begun to grow. I am always sad at this time of day. 
I really want to go back to my home county, and never look back!
There is no better feeling than being home.
