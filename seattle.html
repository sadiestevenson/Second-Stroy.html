Hello Seattle, why are you always raining?
When I rain I can release my emotions. It doesn't need to be happy or sad, but today I am sad.
Today the sky has changed color, and the ocean has begun to grow. I am always sad at this time of day. 
I really want to go back to my home country, and never look back!
There is no better feeling than being home. 
When I'm home I"m surrounded by everything I love.
When I'm home I do not feel like I'm boxed in.
Plus, living in the country puts you closer to nature and away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
I love to be surrounded by my peoople, and see the beautiful, and diverse culture.
